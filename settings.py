# settings.py
"""
The settings registry behind config.py and the admin dashboard.

Every operator-facing setting is declared exactly once, in config.py, through
``env()`` below.  The call records the setting's metadata (group, kind, help
text, choices, bounds) in REGISTRY and returns the raw string value config.py
then parses, exactly as ``os.environ.get`` did before.  That single
declaration is what the admin dashboard renders, validates against and
documents from, so a new setting is a new ``env()`` call and nothing else.

Where a value comes from, in order:

  1. the settings file — what the operator saved in the admin dashboard,
  2. the environment — .env / compose, as before,
  3. the declared default.

The file wins over the environment on purpose: a change made in the UI has
to take effect, and an env var that silently pinned a field would look like a
broken dashboard.  Each field shows which of the three it is using, and
"reset" drops the file value so the env or default shows through again.

Values are only read at import, because every module captures its config
constants at import time.  A save therefore takes effect on the next start;
``pending_restart()`` reports which keys differ between the file and the
running process so the dashboard can say so.
